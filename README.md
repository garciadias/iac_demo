## In this demo I'm explaining how to use git by performing the following steps:

- Create a repository
- Change the README.md file
- Create a branch to add a pair plot
- Merge it into master
- Create a second branch to replace the pair plot with a KDE plot
- Checkout to master and commit a title change to fabricate a conflict when
  merging the second branch into master
- Merge the second branch into master solving the conflict and adding the
  two plots to the final work

A presentation with some useful links to learn git and gitkraken is found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Sfax-NVF1v3h31cdFdt_bt-2reoXKTFASWeVVsked5o/present?token=AC4w5VgnfAgKUzSC9tbCTRWOyLYvERKo7g%3A1511471687823&includes_info_params=1#slide=id.g297646e45a_0_324 "Presentation").
